2. **Maintain responsive navigation** pattern (desktop dropdown, mobile separate links)
3. **Use consistent styling** with existing card-based design
4. **Keep church contact info accurate** across all pages
5. **Test mobile responsiveness** for all new sections

### Navigation Updates:
When updating any page navigation, ensure ALL pages have the consistent pattern:
```html
<div class="nav-dropdown desktop-only">...</div>
<a href="about.html" class="nav-link mobile-only">Values</a>
<a href="team.html" class="nav-link mobile-only">Team</a>
```

### Content Fetching:
Use the fetch_webpage tool to get real content from:
- Main site: https://www.wellspringchurch.cc/
- Specific pages: /about, /ministries, /giving, /contact, /messages

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Complete Messages Page**: Fetch and implement real sermon/message content
2. **Complete Contact Page**: Update with real contact forms and information  
3. **Final Testing**: Ensure all responsive behavior works correctly
4. **Content Review**: Verify all real church information is accurate and up-to-date
